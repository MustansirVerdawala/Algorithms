# Rubik's Cube Solver

A Python-based Rubik’s Cube solver leveraging group theory concepts to find optimal solutions.

---

## Description

This project implements algorithms based on group theory to solve the Rubik’s Cube. The solver models cube states, applies group operations, and generates sequences of moves to restore the cube to its solved state.

---

## Features

- Representation of Rubik’s Cube states using group theory.
- Implementation of common cube moves as group operations.
- Algorithmic solution finder producing step-by-step move sequences.
- Modular Python codebase for easy extension and experimentation.
